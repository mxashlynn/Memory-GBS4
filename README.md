Memory is a traditional pair-matching card game, also known as Concentration, Match Match, N-Spade, and Pexeso, among many other names.  I liked this game a lot as a little kid!

This single-player version uses a deck of 20 cards containing 2 or 4 of each card type.  Ten matches are possible.

I developed this version so that I could learn some new features of [GB Studio 4.x](https://github.com/chrismaltby/gb-studio/).


## Controls 🕹

- D-Pad or Arrow Keys to move the selector.
- A Button or Z Key to flip a card.
- Select Button or Shift Key to review stats.


## Rules 📃

Flip two cards to see if they match.  If they match, the match is recorded and the cards remain face up.  If they do not match, a miss is recorded and the cards are flipped face down again.  Three mismatches in a row means the game is lost.  Once all cards are matched the game is won.

The following cards make up the deck:
- 4 🌙
- 4 🌞
- 4 ✨
- 2 🪐
- 2 🌌
- 2 🌈
- 2 ⚡
