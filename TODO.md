## ðŸš¢ Week of the 31st

We will need to reimplement the algorithm below using the new variables.
Note that we cannot assume that a selected card is either old or new until we check if the turn has already begun.


âœ“ When player selects a card:
    âœ“ Compute selector index
    âœ“ Get value of card at selector index
        âœ“ If the card is already face up:
            âœ“ Do nothing
        âœ“ If the card is face down:
            âœ“ Flip it up, revealing that card
            âœ“ Increment Flips Made Counter
âœ“ When a card is revealed:
    âœ“ Check if Turn has begun
        âœ“ If a Turn has *NOT* begun:
            âœ“ Begin Turn
            âœ“ Set Old Revealed Card Index to this card's index
            âœ“ Set Old Revealed Card Value to this card's value
            âœ“ Set Old Revealed Card X to selector's X
            âœ“ Set Old Revealed Card Y to selector's Y
        âœ“ If a Turn *HAS* begun:
            âœ“ Set New Revealed Card Value to this card's value
            âœ“ Set New Revealed Card Index to this card's index
            âœ“ Set New Revealed Card X to selector's X
            âœ“ Set New Revealed Card Y to selector's Y
            âœ“ Compare values of Old and New cards
                âœ“ If this card's value matches Old Revealed Card's value:
                    âœ“ Play a chime
                    âœ“ Increment total match count
                    âœ“ Reset Flips Remaining
                âœ“ Else:
                    âœ“ Play a buzz
                    âœ“ Flip both cards back over to hide them
                    âœ“ Decrement Flips Remaining
            âœ“ End Turn
