## Shuffle Algorithm

Written here in pseudo-C:
```
for (byte i = high_index; i > low_index; i--)
{
    j = random(from low_index to i);
    push(array[i]);
    push(array[j]);
    array[i] = pop();
    array[j] = pop();
}
```


## Variables

- Game State
    - 0 = Unstarted
    - 1 = In Play
    - 2 = Lost
    - 3 = Won
- Player Match Count
    - 0…10 = How many card pairs found so far.
- Player Flips Made Count
    - 0…MAX_INT = How many flips made so far.
- Player Flips Left Count
    - 3…0 = How many flips remaining till game over.
- Card X,Y
    - 20 variables in a row forming an implicit array
    - Card 0,0 is the upper  left card and has index 4
    - Card 3,4 is the lower right card and has index 23
- Index I & Index J
    - Used in Shuffling algorithm
